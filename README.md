# Sm4shAIEditor

AI File manager capable of mass disassembly and assembly of ATKD, script, and partial disassembly of AIPD filetypes for Smash 4.

**GUI**

Provides an interface to setup workspace/compilation directories from game data and efficiently disassemble/assemble files from any chosen fighter or filetype. The GUI is in progress of being redeveloped to provide useful features, although direct file editing may or may not be left in favor of other tools such as Notepad++

*Note:* This program also supports command line options to directly disassemble/assemble a chosen file/folder. See "-h" for syntax

**Building**

Open in Visual Studio and build. I'll make a release when it's more developed.
